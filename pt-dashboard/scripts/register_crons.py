"""Register the Founder Times' crons, idempotently, from the topic store.

Why this exists at all. `hermes cron` persists jobs to
/var/lib/hermes/cron/jobs.json, which no rebuild replays -- so a rebuilt
agent would come up with subscriptions that never fire and nothing to diff
against. Keeping the spec here, derived from pt/topics.json (the one record
of what the owner asked to be watched), means "set up the plow times crons"
replays a reviewed derivation instead of improvising schedules from a
sentence. The same mechanism ld-dashboard's register_crons.py uses, with a
spec that is data-driven rather than fixed: the topic list changes.

The spec (design doc §3.6 and the personalized-paper plan §3.3/§6):

  pt-daily-edition       <min> <hour> * * *        one job; exists while
                         computed as                setup can register
                         delivery.hour -
                         lead_minutes (owner
                         zone, never before
                         midnight)
  pt-daily-edition-<n>   same, extra_hours         reprint of the MAIN paper
                         (n ≥ 2)                    (unscoped sections), not
                                                    a different roster
  pt-paper-HHMM          same computation          one job per distinct
                         against a section's        section deliver_at that
                         deliver_at                 is not delivery.hour
  pt-subscription-<id>   0 <delivery.hour> * * *   one per subscription topic
                                                   not yet cancelled
  pt-oneoff-<id>         one-shot at the topic's   one per pending one-off
                         scheduled_for             still ahead; swept once
                                                   delivered
  pt-daily-edition-now   one-shot, a minute out    --now: the main paper on
                                                   demand, same prompt, no hold

This script therefore CREATES missing jobs and REMOVES pt-* jobs whose
topic is gone -- cancelled, delivered one-offs, or names with no topic
behind them. "Created/removed as topics change", the design doc calls it. It never touches a job whose name does
not start with pt-: those are not this agent's to manage.

It also RECONCILES drift, which create-if-missing alone does not: a job
that is registered with a different schedule, skill or prompt than the spec
calls for (the owner changed delivery.hour, the lead changed, the delivery
contract moved -- PDF-only vs transcript) is updated in place with
`hermes cron edit`. Without this, "already present, skipped" means a
changed delivery hour or a new chat payload is silently ignored forever --
the exact class of failure this script exists to prevent. Drift is only
judged when hermes's own jobs.json carries the field; a fixture or an older
row without a schedule is left alone rather than edited on a guess. A
blank PLOW_HOME_CHANNEL (typical of docker compose exec, which does not
inherit s6's env) must refuse before any create or edit, while the
existing morning job is still registered. Never remove-then-create a
drifted job: if create failed after remove, the morning paper had no job
until someone reran the script.

One refusal is the point of the script, inherited from ld-dashboard: an
unreadable or unexpected jobs.json aborts. Never read "I could not tell what
is registered" as "nothing is" -- that re-registers every job and duplicates
all of them.

Every stored hour -- delivery.hour, extra_hours, a section's deliver_at --
is the owner's wall clock in owner.timezone. `hermes cron create` takes no
per-job zone and fires on the container's clock (TZ), as post_to_chat.py's
--hold-until waits on it, so this script converts each hour into TZ when it
registers, on today's date. A config still carrying delivery.local_hour was
written when delivery.hour was on the container's clock; adopt_owner_clock()
retires it on the next registration.

It runs INSIDE the container, where /opt/hermes/bin/hermes and that file
live -- from a turn, which inherits PLOW_HOME_CHANNEL from the gateway.
