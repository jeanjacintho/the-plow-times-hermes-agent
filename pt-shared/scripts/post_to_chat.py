"""post_to_chat.py -- the edition's chat leg: POST the PDF (or, if none, the
chat text) to the owner's home channel over the Plow Chat API, directly,
with no dependency on a connected live platform adapter.

Originally the fallback for a run with no --deliver arm. Promoted to the
PRIMARY chat leg (not a fallback) after measuring cron/scheduler.py's own
delivery live: the same unchanged content, run to run, both delivered fine
via --deliver and was silently discarded with "Fire claim ownership lost;
stale result was discarded" -- a genuine intermittent race in Hermes' own
cron heartbeat/claim mechanism, not anything about this script's content.
Calling the Plow Chat REST API directly, the same three calls
plow-chat-platform's own adapter makes internally (declare an attachment,
PUT the bytes to its signed upload_url, POST the message with
attachment_uids), needs no live adapter and is not subject to that race --
it is a plain HTTP call that either succeeds or exits loudly, same as the
text-only POST below always was.

Text is read from ``--text-file`` when provided, otherwise from STDIN only
when there is no PDF. With ``--pdf``, ``--text-file`` is reserved for the
small mail/sports companion omitted from the printed page; without it the
message is attachment-only. The full chat transcript is never a caption.
Omit ``--pdf`` to post text only (the fallback when weasyprint could not
write the file).

The endpoint and credential come
from the process environment alone (PLOW_API_BASE, PLOW_HOME_CHANNEL,
PLOW_AGENT_TOKEN), which first boot publishes from the credential the host
dropped in: a file the agent can write is not a place to look for the API
base its own bearer is sent to. Any of the three unset or blank is refused
BY NAME, before anything posts, so a half-delivered run cannot happen.

`--pdf PATH` attaches that file (declare -> upload -> message-with-
attachment_uids) and optionally sends the companion as its body.
`--hold-until HH:MM` waits until
that clock in TZ before posting; if it has already passed, posts now.
After a successful POST, three
finalizers run independently and best-effort: finalize exactly the topics carried by
`edition.json`, print the run's PDF via print_edition.py when configured (a
miss posts one line saying why), and record via
record_edition.py (`--pdf` and `--text-file` both) on the sibling
`edition.json` -- one's failure never skips or undoes another, and nothing
about the record reaches chat. `--dry-run` prints the redacted envelope and
never sends.
