"""record_edition.py -- put a delivered edition into the owner's wiki.

usage: record_edition.py <run/<id>/edition.json>

Run once the chat leg is out (pt-edition), never before: the wiki records what
the owner received. The day's page is projects/theplowtimes/editions/<date>.md;
each edition that day appends one `## HH:MM edition` block, stamped in the
owner's own zone (`owner_time.owner_now()`), never the container's: the
advisor's card, then every section the owner chose (anything with a
topic_id) with its body, the evidence its research notes hold
(run/<topic_id>/notes.json) and what could not be sourced. Weather,
calendar, mail and sports stay out: they are the day's reads of the owner's
own accounts, and the wiki is every agent's recall.

The page's `priority` frontmatter is the card of the day's chronologically
latest edition (by its own `HH:MM`, not by write order -- two papers can
record out of order, and the earlier one finishing second must not overwrite
a later card with an older one; `priority_at` is that edition's timestamp,
kept only to judge the next write). Its `sections` frontmatter is each topic
id's own record (headline and every sourced claim), merged across the day's
editions. `updated` is monotonic for the same reason: an edition recording
out of order must not move it backward and have the page announce an older
update than the write that already landed. history.py reads both `priority`
and `sections` back as history. After the write, `wiki
validate` and `wiki index`, so the paper's page lists the day.

The renderer already refused a malformed edition.json before delivery, so the
fields it requires are read directly.

Prints `RECORDED <page>` or `SKIPPED: <why>`. A failure exits non-zero with
`error: edition not recorded — <why>`; the delivery it follows still stands.
