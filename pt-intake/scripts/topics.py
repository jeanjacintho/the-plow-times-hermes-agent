"""topics.py -- the single writer for /var/lib/hermes/pt/topics.json.

The topic list is this agent's ENTIRE durable model of what it has been
asked to do (design doc §3.3): every subscription's nightly cron, every
one-off's scheduled run and every status question in chat reads it. That
makes it the one file nothing may improvise writes against -- a hand-edited
JSON blob in a turn is exactly how a subscription silently stops firing --
so all mutation goes through this script's subcommands, which validate the
kind, depth and status transitions and write atomically.

Reads are equally guarded: an unreadable or unexpected topics.json must stop
the run rather than read as "no topics", which is the invariant that keeps a
malformed file from dropping every subscription on the floor (the same rule
ld-dashboard's register_crons.py holds for jobs.json).

Subcommands:
  add      --text TEXT --kind {one_off,subscription,section,assignment}
           --depth {quick,deep} [--run-on YYYY-MM-DD] [--deliver-at HH:MM]
           [--scheduled-for ISO8601]
  cancel   <id>            any topic the owner says stop on
  mark     <id> --status {pending,running,delivered} [--at ISO8601]
  list     [--kind K]      prints the topics array as JSON
  check-paper --deliver-at {main,HH:MM} [--as-of YYYY-MM-DD]
                           validates one paper's three-item news roster
  finalize-edition <edition.json> [--at ISO8601]
                           stamps only carried topics after a successful post
  reopen-sections          every section/subscription that is delivered or
                           running becomes pending (a paper about to run;
                           measured live, delivered sections were skipped
                           and the next edition had desks only)

`--run-on` is the date a `section`/`assignment` belongs to the paper:
required for `assignment` (the one day its result appears) and refused for
every other kind. Strict `YYYY-MM-DD`, never a parsed guess.

`--deliver-at` is the container-local `HH:MM` a `section` belongs to a
different paper than the main daily edition. Required for nothing: absent
means the section rides the main paper at `delivery.hour`. Refused for
every kind except `section`. Same `HH:MM` shape as `delivery.hour`.

Every mutating subcommand prints a JSON envelope with the affected topic.
Exit status is non-zero on any refusal, and the refusal names the reason.

Status transitions (design doc §3.3):
  pending  -> running                  every kind (a run started)
  running  -> delivered                every kind (an edition shipped)
  running  -> pending                  subscription/section only (awaiting
                                       the next run; a one-off/assignment that
                                       fails stays running so the failure is
                                       visible, not silent)
  delivered -> pending                 subscription/section only (the nightly
                                       cycle)
  anything non-terminal -> cancelled   the owner said stop; a delivered
                                       one-off OR assignment is terminal and
                                       cannot be cancelled

`PT_HOME` overrides the state directory (tests use it); it defaults to
/var/lib/hermes/pt. Timestamps are ISO 8601 with the container's offset.
